        captionText: "I relish learning new things and have always kept myself busy with new projects that require some solid amount of research. From remodeling my own home to working with a small homemade laptop fan; I have the habit of diving in and looking more than just the hot tip on how to do something. I really love to understand why things work the way they do. So far my favorite is the electric shovel guitar, Learning how to setup the electronics was exciting and fun. I'll relish using that 'Jack-Of-All-Trade' skillset to anything I dive into while working to give the best product possible."

        title: "Leaders Know How to Follow",
        captionText: "In school programs and ROTC I found myself in leadership rolls and the ideals that helped me understand what made a good leader followed me into my worklife. During that time frame I learned that good leaders first have to understand how to follow the direction of others that have experience. Without learning from those who have walked the path before you, it is difficult to understand what virtues a good leader has. Knowing that we don't know everything is always a great place to simmer. This way we keep our minds open to learning new things and are able to filter out our own biases."
